## Description

Successfully detected the road signs such as Stop signs and School zone signs using Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN). The transfer learning technique is considered faster than the traditional method and so leveraged a pre-trained data (Cifar10Net) to train the stop sign and school zone sign. Detected both the signs with a 99% confidence level. Included the test video, labelled ground truth data as a .mat file, MATLAB code to execute transfer learning using the pretrained data, and the main MATLAB code that calls the trained rcnn and the test video to produce the final output.
